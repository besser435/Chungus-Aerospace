How to set up filesystem:
For launch: Uncomment prep_files(), press button, and you are ready

For REPL viewing and code execution: set dev mode to true, upload that to the drive, 
then plug into computer with with pin A0 jumped to ground

For editing code/changing files on the drive: just plug in and do whatever
